# Distributed System Projects

This project showcases the working of Chandy-Lamport and Lai-Yang algorithms separately. Both have been implemented on a similar distributed system ie. a simple banking transaction system. 

It is built on akka typed in scala.

## Steps
- Please clone this repository and go to the folder for the algorithm you wish to run.
- Respective Readmes are provided for each individual algorithm.
- For further details refer [ChandyLamportReadme](https://github.com/messicode/Distributed_Systems/blob/master/ChandyLamport/Readme.md) and [LaiYangReadme](https://github.com/messicode/Distributed_Systems/blob/master/LaiYang/Readme.md)
